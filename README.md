# Description ðŸ§ 
GitOSINT is a Discord bot that helps you to find information/intelligence on Github users.
Simply invite the BOT to your server.
Many CTF teams spend hours on discord sharing their findings, inviting the BOT to your server is a time saver, no need to search manually on GitHub or to open python scripts, just run the search from your server and get results.

# Why use a Discord Bot ðŸ¦¾
